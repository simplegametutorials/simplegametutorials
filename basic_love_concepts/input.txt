# Basic LOVE concepts

LOVE's homepage is: <a href="https://love2d.org/">https://love2d.org/</a>

The current LOVE version at the time this document was last updated is 0.10.1.

LOVE uses <a href="http://luajit.org/extensions.html">LuaJIT 2.0</a>. You don't need to install this or any other Lua version to use LOVE.

## What LOVE can run on

LOVE projects can be run on Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS and (unofficially) <a href="https://github.com/TannerRogalsky/love.js">web browsers</a>.

## What LOVE provides

LOVE provides a way of displaying graphics, playing sound, and getting user input, among other things.

LOVE doesn't provide things which can be written in Lua code, unless it would be too slow.

For example, LOVE doesn't provide anything specifically for animations, because animations can be made with Lua code that uses what LOVE provides.

However, LOVE does provide a particle system and a physics system, because they are significantly faster than if they were made with Lua code.

## Running LOVE projects

A LOVE project is a directory or zip file containing a *main.lua* file and any other files used.

A project can be run via the command line by *love.exe path_to_love_project* on Windows, *love path_to_love_project* on Linux, or *open -n -a love path_to_love_project* on Mac.

Or, it can be run by dragging and dropping the LOVE project on to *love.exe* on Windows or *love.app* on Mac.

Zip files with the extension *.love* will be opened automatically by LOVE. Files with the extension *.love* can be renamed to have the extension *.zip* and unzipped.

For more information on running LOVE projects, see this page: <a href="https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started">https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started</a>

## Distribution

LOVE projects can be made into *.exe* files for Windows, *.app* files for Mac, and so on. For more information, see this page: <a href="https://love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution">https://love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution</a>

## Control flow

When a LOVE project is run, LOVE runs *conf.lua* and the function `love.conf` (if they exist), then runs *main.lua*, then runs the function `love.run`, then closes.

A default `love.run` function is used if it isn't overwritten by the project's code, and this default is what calls the rest of the callbacks mentioned below.

For more information on `love.run`, see this page: <a href="https://love2d.org/wiki/love.run">https://love2d.org/wiki/love.run</a>

*main.lua* is intended for the main code.

## Callbacks

Control flow in LOVE uses callbacks.

LOVE's callbacks are functions which you create and LOVE runs at specific times.

For example, `love.load` is run once LOVE has loaded.

Every frame, `love.update` is run, which is intended for updating the state of the program, then `love.draw` is run, which is intended for drawing to the screen.

`love.update` is given the time since it was last run in seconds as a parameter.

`love.keypressed` is run when a key on the keyboard is pressed, and is given which key it was as a parameter.

For example:

`
function love.load()
    randomNumber = love.math.random()
    totalTime = 0
    x = 15
end

function love.update(dt)
    totalTime = totalTime + dt
    x = x + (10 * dt)
end

function love.draw()
    love.graphics.print('The random number is '..randomNumber, 15, 15)
    love.graphics.print('The program has been running for '..totalTime..' seconds', 15, 30)
    love.graphics.print('This text is moving right at 10 pixels per second', x, 45)
end

function love.keypressed(key)
    if key == 'r' then
        randomNumber = love.math.random()
    elseif key == 'x' then
        x = 15
    end
end
`

LOVE has around 35 callbacks.

For information on all of the callbacks, see this page: <a href="https://love2d.org/wiki/love#Callbacks">https://love2d.org/wiki/love#Callbacks</a>

## Configuration

`love.conf` is a callback defined in *conf.lua* which is called before modules are loaded and before *main.lua* is run.

It can set the initial window properties and disable modules among other things.

For more information on configuration, see this page: <a href="https://love2d.org/wiki/Config_Files">https://love2d.org/wiki/Config_Files</a>

## Functions

LOVE provides functions which you can call to do things.

`love.graphics.print` is an example of a function, so is `love.math.random`.

LOVE has around 255 functions.

For information on all of the functions, see each module's page: <a href="https://love2d.org/wiki/love#Modules">https://love2d.org/wiki/love#Modules</a>

## Convenience functions

Some functions provide a quicker way of doing something which could be done in another way.

For example, this code creates a new Font with `love.graphics.newFont` and sets the internal state to use this font with `love.graphics.setFont`.

`
function love.load()
    love.graphics.setFont(love.graphics.newFont('font.ttf', 20))
end
`

`love.graphics.setNewFont` is a convenience function which does the same thing.

`
function love.load()
    love.graphics.setNewFont('font.ttf', 20)
end
`

## Internal state

LOVE has state in a running program which affects the behavior of the program and can be changed/retrieved by functions. Functions for changing state often start with *set* and functions for retrieving state often start with *get*.

For example, `love.graphics.setColor` changes the state of the drawing color, and `love.graphics.getColor` retrieves it.

`
function love.draw()
    love.graphics.setColor(255, 255, 255)
    red, green, blue = love.graphics.getColor()
    love.graphics.print(
        'The color state currently has a red value of '..red..
        ' and a green value of '..green..
        ' and a blue value of '..blue,
        15, 15
    )

    love.graphics.setColor(255, 51, 133)
    red, green, blue = love.graphics.getColor()
    love.graphics.print(
        'The color state currently has a red value of '..red..
        ' and a green value of '..green..
        ' and a blue value of '..blue,
        15, 30
    )
end
`

## Objects

Objects are returned by "constructor" functions, and can be used by other functions to do things. Constructor functions generally start with *new*.

For example, *Image* objects are returned by `love.graphics.newImage`. They can be drawn to the screen with `love.graphics.draw`.

`
function love.load()
    image1 = love.graphics.newImage('image1.png')
    image2 = love.graphics.newImage('image2.png')
end

function love.draw()
    love.graphics.draw(image1, 15, 15)
    love.graphics.draw(image2, 15, 100)
end
`

LOVE has around 47 object types, 22 of which are in the *physics* module.

For information on all of the objects, see each module's page: <a href="https://love2d.org/wiki/love#Modules">https://love2d.org/wiki/love#Modules</a>

## Object state and functions

Objects have their own individual state.

Objects have functions which change or retrieve the object's state, or have external effects based on the object's state.

For example, `Image:setFilter` changes the way an *Image* looks when it is drawn scaled, and `Image:getFilter` retrieves it.

`
function love.load()
    image1 = love.graphics.newImage('image1.png')
end

function love.draw()
    image1:setFilter('linear')
    love.graphics.print('The image filter is '..image1:getFilter(), 15, 15)
    love.graphics.draw(image1, 15, 35, 0, 2)

    image1:setFilter('nearest')
    love.graphics.print('The image filter is '..image1:getFilter(), 15, 115)
    love.graphics.draw(image1, 15, 135, 0, 2)
end
`

LOVE has around 518 object functions, 232 of which are in the *physics* module.

## Modules

LOVE's internal code is divided into modules.

Modules can be disabled in `love.conf`.

LOVE's functions are within tables named after the module they are in. For example, `love.graphics.newImage` is in the *graphics* module.

LOVE has around 17 modules.
