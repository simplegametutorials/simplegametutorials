## Rules

There is a grid of cells, which are either alive of dead.

After a step of time:

- Alive cells with exactly two or three alive neighbors live on
- Dead cells with exactly three alive neighbors become alive

All other cells die.

Create an initial configuration of cells, hold a key to step forward in time, and observe.

### Controls

& *Left click* & Make cell alive
& *Right click* & Make cell dead
& *Any key* & Step forward in time

## Overview

The cells are stored as a grid of boolean values, true for alive and false for dead.

!

When time steps forward, a new grid is created, and whether the cells of this new grid are alive or dead is based on the current grid.

After the new grid has been created, the current grid is replaced with the new grid.

## Coding

### Drawing a cell

A cell is drawn as a square.

`
function love.draw()
    love.graphics.rectangle(
        'fill',
        0,
        0,
        4,
        4
    )
end
`

!

### Drawing a row of cells

A row of cells are drawn, with 1 pixel between each cell.

`
function love.draw()
    |for x = 1, 70 do|
        |local cellSize = 5|
        |local cellDrawSize = cellSize - 1|

        love.graphics.rectangle(
            'fill',
            |(x - 1) * cellSize,|
            0,
            |cellDrawSize|,
            |cellDrawSize|
        )
    |end|
end
`

!

### Drawing all the cells

All of the rows are drawn.

`
function love.draw()
    |for y = 1, 50 do|
        for x = 1, 70 do
            local cellSize = 5
            local cellDrawSize = cellSize - 1

            love.graphics.rectangle(
                'fill',
                (x - 1) * cellSize,
                |(y - 1) * cellSize,|
                cellDrawSize,
                cellDrawSize
            )
        end
    |end|
end
`

!

### Setting colors

The background and dead cell colors are set.

`
function love.load()
    love.graphics.setBackgroundColor(255, 255, 255)
end

function love.draw()
    for y = 1, 50 do
        for x = 1, 70 do
            local cellSize = 5
            local cellDrawSize = cellSize - 1

            |love.graphics.setColor(220, 220, 220)|
            love.graphics.rectangle(
                'fill',
                (x - 1) * cellSize,
                (y - 1) * cellSize,
                cellDrawSize,
                cellDrawSize
            )
        end
    end
end
`

!

### Selecting cells

The cell position that the mouse cursor is over is stored.

This is calculated by taking the mouse position and dividing it by the cell size, flooring this number, then adding 1 to it.

For example, if the mouse is at position 17 on the X axis and the cell size is 5, dividing 17 by 5 gives 3.4, flooring 3.4 gives 3, and adding 1 gives 4, meaning that the mouse is in cell 4 on the X axis.

The cell size is needed to calculate this, so it moved into `love.load`.

The square at this position is set to the selected color.

For now, this position is drawn to the screen as text.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.

    cellSize = 5
end

function love.update()
    selectedX = math.floor(love.mouse.getX() / cellSize) + 1
    selectedY = math.floor(love.mouse.getY() / cellSize) + 1
end

function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    -- Removed: local cellSize = 5

    -- Temporary
    love.graphics.setColor(0, 0, 0)
    love.graphics.print('selected x: '..selectedX..', selected y: '..selectedY)
end
`

!

### Highlighting cells

The square under the mouse cursor is set to the selected color.

`
function love.draw()
    for y = 1, 50 do
        for x = 1, 70 do
            -- Removed: local cellSize = 5
            local cellDrawSize = cellSize - 1

            |if x == selectedX and y == selectedY then|
            |    love.graphics.setColor(0, 255, 255)|
            |else|
                love.graphics.setColor(220, 220, 220)
            |end|

            love.graphics.rectangle(
                'fill',
                (x - 1) * cellSize,
                (y - 1) * cellSize,
                cellDrawSize,
                cellDrawSize
            )
        end
    end
end
`

!

### Creating the grid

A grid is created to store the cells.

Each cell is represented by a boolean value: true for alive, false for dead.

If the cell is alive, the alive color is used to draw the cell.

To test this, some cells are manually set to alive.

The grid's width/height in cells is reused from drawing the cells, so variables are made for these.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.

    gridXCount = 70
    gridYCount = 50

    grid = {}
    for y = 1, gridYCount do
        grid[y] = {}
        for x = 1, gridXCount do
            grid[y][x] = false
        end
    end

    -- Temporary
    grid[1][1] = true
    grid[1][2] = true
end

function love.draw()
    for y = 1, |gridYCount| do
        for x = 1, |gridXCount| do
            local cellDrawSize = cellSize - 1

            if x == selectedX and y == selectedY then
                love.graphics.setColor(0, 255, 255)
            |elseif grid[y][x] then|
            |    love.graphics.setColor(255, 0, 255)|
            else
                love.graphics.setColor(220, 220, 220)
            end

            love.graphics.rectangle(
                'fill',
                (x - 1) * cellSize,
                (y - 1) * cellSize,
                cellDrawSize,
                cellDrawSize
            )
        end
    end
end
`

!

### Set cells alive with left mouse button

If the left mouse button is down, the selected cell is set to alive.

`
function love.update()
    -- etc.

    if love.mouse.isDown(1) then
        grid[selectedY][selectedX] = true
    end
end
`

!

### Only set cell alive when mouse is within grid

Setting the cell to alive is only possible if the selected X/Y position is within the grid.

`
function love.update()
    selectedX = math.floor(love.mouse.getX() / cellSize) + 1
    selectedY = math.floor(love.mouse.getY() / cellSize) + 1

    if love.mouse.isDown(1)
    |and selectedX <= gridXCount|
    |and selectedY <= gridYCount| then
        grid[selectedY][selectedX] = true
    end
end
`

### Getting number of neighbors

Changing the grid after a step of time requires knowing how many alive neighbors each cell has.

For now, right clicking a cell will print out how many alive neighbors it has.

`grid[selectedY + dy]` is checked to see if it exists before `grid[selectedY + dy][selectedX + dx]`, because if `selectedY + dy` is not on the grid, then `grid[selectedY + dy]` will return nil, and `grid[selectedY + dy][selectedX + dx]` will error because the `[selectedX + dx]` part is trying to index nil.

`
function love.mousepressed(mouseX, mouseY, button)
    -- Temporary.
    if button == 2 then
        local neighbourCount = 0

        print('Finding neighbors of grid['..selectedY..']['..selectedX..']')

        for dy = -1, 1 do
            for dx = -1, 1 do

                print('Checking grid['..selectedY + dy..']['..selectedX + dx..']')

                if not (dy == 0 and dx == 0)
                and grid[selectedY + dy]
                and grid[selectedY + dy][selectedX + dx] then
                    
                    print('Neighbour found')
                    neighbourCount = neighbourCount + 1
                end
            end
        end

        print('Total neighbors: '..neighbourCount)
    end    
end
`

### Changing grid on key press

When a key is pressed, a new grid is created, and the old grid is replaced by the new grid.

For now, all of the cells in the new grid will be alive.

`
function love.keypressed()
    local nextGrid = {}
    for y = 1, gridYCount do
        nextGrid[y] = {}
        for x = 1, gridXCount do
            nextGrid[y][x] = true
        end
    end

    grid = nextGrid
end
`

!

### Changing grid based on neighbors

The code for finding the number of alive neighbors a cell has is moved to here.

A cell in the new grid is alive if it has 3 neighbors, or it is alive in the old grid and has 2 neighbors.

`
function love.keypressed()
    local nextGrid = {}
    for y = 1, gridYCount do
        nextGrid[y] = {}
        for x = 1, gridXCount do
            local neighbourCount = 0

            for dy = -1, 1 do
                for dx = -1, 1 do
                    if not (dy == 0 and dx == 0)
                    and grid[y + dy]
                    and grid[y + dy][x + dx] then
                        neighbourCount = neighbourCount + 1
                    end
                end
            end

            nextGrid[y][x] = |neighbourCount == 3 or (grid[y][x] and neighbourCount == 2)|
        end
    end

    grid = nextGrid
end
`

!

### Making cells dead with right click

When a cell is right clicked it becomes dead.

`
function love.update()
    -- etc.

    if love.mouse.isDown(1) then
        grid[selectedY][selectedX] = true
    |elseif love.mouse.isDown(2) then|
    |    grid[selectedY][selectedX] = false|
    end
end
`

### Turning key repeat on

Key repeat is turned on so holding a key down will call `love.keypressed` repeatedly.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.

    love.keyboard.setKeyRepeat(true)
end
`

## Final code

`
function love.load()
    love.graphics.setBackgroundColor(255, 255, 255)

    cellSize = 5
    
    gridXCount = 70
    gridYCount = 50

    grid = {}
    for y = 1, gridYCount do
        grid[y] = {}
        for x = 1, gridXCount do
            grid[y][x] = false
        end
    end

    love.keyboard.setKeyRepeat(true)
end

function love.update()
    selectedX = math.floor(love.mouse.getX() / cellSize) + 1
    selectedY = math.floor(love.mouse.getY() / cellSize) + 1
    
    if love.mouse.isDown(1)
    and selectedX <= gridXCount
    and selectedY <= gridYCount then
        grid[selectedY][selectedX] = true
    elseif love.mouse.isDown(2) then
        grid[selectedY][selectedX] = false
    end
end

    for y = 1, 50 do
        for x = 1, 70 do
            local cellDrawSize = cellSize - 1

            if x == selectedX and y == selectedY then
                love.graphics.setColor(0, 255, 255)

                love.graphics.setColor(255, 0, 255)
            else
                love.graphics.setColor(220, 220, 220)
            end

            love.graphics.rectangle(

                cellDrawSize,
                cellDrawSize
            )
        end
    end
end

function love.keypressed()
    local nextGrid = {}
    for y = 1, gridYCount do
        nextGrid[y] = {}
        for x = 1, gridXCount do
            local neighbors = 0

            for dy = -1, 1 do
                for dx = -1, 1 do
                    if not (dy == 0 and dx == 0)
                    and grid[y + dy]
                    and grid[y + dy][x + dx] then
                        neighbors = neighbors + 1
                    end
                end
            end

            nextGrid[y][x] = neighbors == 3 or (grid[y][x] and neighbors == 2)
        end
    end

    grid = nextGrid
end
