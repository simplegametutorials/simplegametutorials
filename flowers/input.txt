## Rules

The game starts with a grid of covered cells. Under some of the cells are flowers. The game is over when a flower is uncovered.

Left clicking a cell uncovers it, and if none of its adjacent cells contain flowers, they are also uncovered, and for <i>those</i> uncovered cells, if none of <i>their</i> adjacent cells contain flowers, they are also uncovered, and so on.

Right clicking a cell toggles between the cell having a flag, a question mark, or nothing. Flags prevent a cell from being uncovered with a left click. Question marks are visual markers which don't affect what happens when the cell is clicked.

## Controls

& *Left click* & Uncover a cell
& *Right click* & Cycle a covered cell through having a flag, a question mark, or nothing

## Overview

The cells are represented by tables containing a boolean value indicating whether or not it contains a flower, and a string value indicating which of four states the cell is in: covered, covered with a flag, covered with a question mark, or uncovered.

The cells which have flowers are chosen randomly. The first cell clicked is excluded from the possible options.

When a cell is clicked, its position is added to the "uncover stack" table.

While there is anything left in the uncover stack...

- A position is removed from the end of the stack.
- This position is set to *uncovered*.
- If there are no flowers surrounding this position, the surrounding *covered* and *question marked* positions (i.e. not the *uncovered* and *flagged* positions) are added to the uncover stack.

The cells are drawn by assembling the following images:

!

To obtain these images, <a href="flowers.love">download flowers.love</a>, rename the extension from .love to .zip and then unzip the file. Inside the directory there will be the directory of images that you can use in your project. 

## Coding

### Loading images

All of the images needed for the game are loaded into a table.

`
function love.load()
    images = {}
    for imageIndex, image in ipairs({
        1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
        'uncovered', 'covered_highlighted', 'covered', 'flower', 'flag', 'question',
    }) do
        images[image] = love.graphics.newImage('images/'..image..'.png')
    end
end
`

### Drawing tiles

The covered cell image is drawn for every cell.

`
function love.draw()
    for y = 1, 14 do
        for x = 1, 19 do
            local cellSize = 18
            love.graphics.draw(images.covered, (x - 1) * cellSize, (y - 1) * cellSize)
        end
    end
end
`

!

### Selecting cells

The cell position under the mouse is updated every frame.

This needs the cell size, so it is moved from `love.draw` to `love.load`.

For now, this position is drawn as text.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.
    
    |cellSize = 18|
end

function love.update()
    selectedX = math.floor(love.mouse.getX() / cellSize) + 1
    selectedY = math.floor(love.mouse.getY() / cellSize) + 1
end

function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    -- Removed: local cellSize = 18

    -- Temporary
    love.graphics.setColor(0, 0, 0)
    love.graphics.print('selected x: '..selectedX..' selected y: '..selectedY)
    love.graphics.setColor(1, 1, 1)
end
`

!

### Keeping selected cell within grid

If the mouse position is greater than the grid's X or Y cell count (i.e. it is off the right or bottom of the grid), then the selected position is set to the last cell in that direction.

The grid's X and Y cell count is reused from drawing the cells, so variables are made for these.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.

    gridXCount = 19
    gridYCount = 14
end

function love.update()
    selectedX = math.floor(love.mouse.getX() / cellSize) + 1
    selectedY = math.floor(love.mouse.getY() / cellSize) + 1

    |if selectedX > gridXCount then|
    |    selectedX = gridXCount|
    |end|
    |if selectedY > gridYCount then|
    |    selectedY = gridYCount|
    |end|
end

function love.draw()
    for y = 1, |gridYCount| do
        for x = 1, |gridXCount| do

        -- etc.
end
`

!

### Highlighting cells

The selected cell is a drawn with the highlighted image.

`
function love.draw()
    for y = 1, gridYCount do
        for x = 1, gridXCount do
            |local image|

            |if x == selectedX and y == selectedY then|
            |    image = images.covered_highlighted|
            |else|
            |    image = images.covered|
            |end|

            love.graphics.draw(|image|, (x - 1) * cellSize, (y - 1) * cellSize)
        end
    end
end
`

!

### Change cell image when left mouse button is down

When the left mouse button is down, the selected cell is drawn as an uncovered cell.

`
function love.draw()
    for y = 1, gridYCount do
        for x = 1, gridXCount do
            local image

            if x == selectedX and y == selectedY then
                |if love.mouse.isDown(1) then|
                |    image = images.uncovered|
                |else|
                    image = images.covered_highlighted
                |end|
            else
                image = images.covered
            end

            love.graphics.draw(image, (x - 1) * cellSize, (y - 1) * cellSize)
        end
    end
end
`

!

### Drawing flowers

A grid is created to store the state of the cells.

Each cell is represented by a table which stores two values: whether it has a flower, and whether it is uncovered/flagged/question marked/nothing.

If a cell's `'flower'` key is true, the flower image is drawn over the cell image.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.

    grid = {}
    for y = 1, gridYCount do
        grid[y] = {}
        for x = 1, gridXCount do
            grid[y][x] = {
                flower = false,
            }
        end
    end

    -- Temporary
    grid[1][1].flower = true
    grid[1][2].flower = true
end
 
function love.draw()
    for y = 1, gridYCount do
        for x = 1, gridXCount do
            -- etc.
            
            |if grid[y][x].flower then|
            |    love.graphics.draw(images.flower, (x - 1) * cellSize, (y - 1) * cellSize)|
            |end|
        end
    end
end
`

!

### Simplifying code

The code for drawing covered cells and drawing the flower is the same except for the image to draw, so a function is created with the image and the X and Y values as parameters.

`
function love.draw()
    for y = 1, gridYCount do
        for x = 1, gridXCount do
            |local function drawCell(image, x, y)|
                love.graphics.draw(image, (x - 1) * cellSize, (y - 1) * cellSize)
            |end|
            
            if x == selectedX and y == selectedY then
                if love.mouse.isDown(1) then
                    |drawCell(images.uncovered, x, y)|
                else
                    |drawCell(images.covered_highlighted, x, y)|
                end
            else
                |drawCell(images.covered, x, y)|
            end

            if grid[y][x].flower then
                |drawCell(images.flower, x, y)|
            end
        end
    end
end
`

### Toggling flowers

For testing purposes, right clicking a cell will toggle its flower.

`
function love.mousereleased(mouseX, mouseY, button)
    if button == 2 then
        grid[selectedY][selectedX].flower = not grid[selectedY][selectedX].flower
    end
end
`

### Showing surrounding flower count

To find the surrounding flower count, each position in the 8 directions around each cell is looped through. If any of these positions is not outside the grid (i.e. the value at the position is not nil) and the cell at the position has a flower, then 1 is added to the surrounding flower count.

If the surrounding flower count is greater than 0, then the appropriate number image is drawn over the cell.

`
function love.draw()
    for y = 1, gridYCount do
        for x = 1, gridXCount do
            local function drawCell(image, x, y)
                love.graphics.draw(image, (x - 1) * cellSize, (y - 1) * cellSize)
            end

            if x == selectedX and y == selectedY then
                if love.mouse.isDown(1) then
                    drawCell(images.uncovered, x, y)
                else
                    drawCell(images.covered_highlighted, x, y)
                end
            else
                drawCell(images.covered, x, y)
            end

            |local surroundingFlowerCount = 0|

            |for dy = -1, 1 do|
            |    for dx = -1, 1 do|
            |        if not (dy == 0 and dx == 0)|
            |        and grid[y + dy]|
            |        and grid[y + dy][x + dx]|
            |        and grid[y + dy][x + dx].flower then|
            |            surroundingFlowerCount = surroundingFlowerCount + 1|
            |        end|
            |    end|
            |end|

            if grid[y][x].flower then
                drawCell(images.flower, x, y)
            |elseif surroundingFlowerCount > 0 then|
            |    drawCell(images[surroundingFlowerCount], x, y)|
            end
        end
    end
end
`

!

### Random flower placement

A table is created containing every X and Y position in the grid.

Random positions are repeatedly removed from this table and the cells at these positions are set to have a flower.

To test this, pressing any key calls `love.load`.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.

    local possibleFlowerPositions = {}
    for y = 1, gridYCount do
        for x = 1, gridXCount do
            table.insert(possibleFlowerPositions, {x = x, y = y})
        end
    end

    for flowerIndex = 1, 40 do
        local position = table.remove(possibleFlowerPositions, love.math.random(#possibleFlowerPositions))
        grid[position.y][position.x].flower = true
    end
end

function love.keypressed()
    -- Temporary
    love.load()
end
`

!

### Uncovering cells

The cells are given a new key for the state of the cell. For now, this is only whether the cell is covered or uncovered.

For now, when a cell is left clicked its state is set to `'uncovered'`.

If a cell's state is `'uncovered'`, then the uncovered image is drawn instead of the covered image.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.

    grid = {}
    for y = 1, gridYCount do
        grid[y] = {}
        for x = 1, gridXCount do
            grid[y][x] = {
                flower = false,
                |state = 'covered', -- 'covered', 'uncovered'|
            }
        end
    end
end

function love.mousereleased(mouseX, mouseY, button)
    if button == 1 then
        grid[selectedY][selectedX].state = 'uncovered'
    end
end

function love.draw()
    for y = 1, gridYCount do
        for x = 1, gridXCount do
            -- etc.

            |if grid[y][x].state == 'uncovered' then|
            |    drawCell(images.uncovered, x, y)|
            |else|
                if x == selectedX and y == selectedY then
                    if love.mouse.isDown(1) then
                        drawCell(images.uncovered, x, y)
                    else
                        drawCell(images.covered_highlighted, x, y)
                    end
                else
                    drawCell(images.covered, x, y)
                end
            |end|

            -- etc.
        end
    end
end
`

!

### Flood fill: uncover stack

Instead of uncovering a single cell, a stack of cells is created.

While there are positions in the uncover stack, a position is removed from it and the cell at this position on the grid is uncovered.

For now, it will just contain the selected position, so it will only uncover the selected cell like before.

`
function love.mousereleased(mouseX, mouseY, button)
    if button == 1 then
        local stack = {
            {
                x = selectedX,
                y = selectedY,
            }
        }

        while #stack > 0 do
            local current = table.remove(stack)
            local x = current.x
            local y = current.y

            grid[y][x].state = 'uncovered'
        end
    end
end
`

### Flood fill: adding to the stack

Each position in the 8 directions around each cell is looped through, and if the position is not outside the grid (i.e. the position on the grid is not nil) and it is covered, then, for now, it added to the uncover stack.

This results in all of the cells becoming uncovered.

`
function love.mousereleased(mouseX, mouseY, button)
    if button == 1 then
        local stack = {
            {
                x = selectedX,
                y = selectedY,
            }
        }

        while #stack > 0 do
            local current = table.remove(stack)
            local x = current.x
            local y = current.y

            grid[y][x].state = 'uncovered'

            |for dy = -1, 1 do|
            |    for dx = -1, 1 do|
            |        if not (dx == 0 and dy == 0)|
            |        and grid[y + dy]|
            |        and grid[y + dy][x + dx]|
            |        and grid[y + dy][x + dx].state == 'covered' then|
            |            table.insert(|
            |                stack, {|
            |                    x = x + dx,|
            |                    y = y + dy|
            |                }|
            |            )|
            |        end|
            |    end|
            |end|
        end
    end
end
`

!

### Flood fill: using surrounding flower count

The surrounding cells of a position removed from the uncover stack are only added to the stack if none of the surrounding cells have flowers.

Finding the number of surrounding flowers is reused from drawing it, so a function is made.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.

    |function getSurroundingFlowerCount(x, y)|
        local surroundingFlowerCount = 0

        for dy = -1, 1 do
            for dx = -1, 1 do
                if not (dy == 0 and dx == 0)
                and grid[y + dy]
                and grid[y + dy][x + dx]
                and grid[y + dy][x + dx].flower
                then
                    surroundingFlowerCount = surroundingFlowerCount + 1
                end
            end
        end

        |return surroundingFlowerCount|
    |end|
end

function love.draw()
            -- etc.

            if grid[y][x].flower then
                drawCell(images.flower, x, y)
            elseif |getSurroundingFlowerCount(x, y)| > 0 then
                drawCell(images[|getSurroundingFlowerCount(x, y)|], x, y)
            end
        end
    end
end

function love.mousereleased(mouseX, mouseY, button)
    if button == 1 then
        local stack = {
            {
                x = selectedX,
                y = selectedY,
            }
        }

        while #stack > 0 do
            local current = table.remove(stack)
            local x = current.x
            local y = current.y

            grid[y][x].state = 'uncovered'

            |if getSurroundingFlowerCount(x, y) == 0 then|
                for dy = -1, 1 do
                    for dx = -1, 1 do
                        if not (dx == 0 and dy == 0)
                        and grid[y + dy]
                        and grid[y + dy][x + dx]
                        and grid[y + dy][x + dx].state == 'covered' then
                            table.insert(
                                stack, {
                                    x = x + dx,
                                    y = y + dy
                                }
                            )
                        end
                    end
                end
            |end|
        end
    end
end
`

!

### Drawing flags and question marks

A cell's state can also be a flag or a question mark.

If a cell's state is a flag/question mark, the flag/question mark image is drawn over the cell.

To test this, the state of two cells are changed to have a flag and a question mark.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.

    grid = {}
    for y = 1, gridYCount do
        grid[y] = {}
        for x = 1, gridXCount do
            grid[y][x] = {
                flower = false,
                state = 'covered', -- 'covered', 'uncovered', |'flag', 'question'|
            }
        end
    end

    |-- Temporary|
    |grid[1][1].state = 'flag'|
    |grid[1][2].state = 'question'|

    -- etc.
end

function love.draw()
            -- etc.

            if grid[y][x].flower then
                drawCell(images.flower, x, y)
            elseif getSurroundingFlowerCount(x, y) > 0 then
                drawCell(images[getSurroundingFlowerCount(x, y)], x, y)
            end

            |if grid[y][x].state == 'flag' then|
            |    drawCell(images.flag, x, y)|
            |elseif grid[y][x].state == 'question' then|
            |    drawCell(images.question, x, y)|
            |end|
        end
    end
end
`

!

### Cycling flags and question marks

Right clicking a cell cycles its state through having nothing, a flag, and a question mark.

`
function love.mousereleased(mouseX, mouseY, button)
    if button == 1 then
        -- etc.

    elseif button == 2 then
        if grid[selectedY][selectedX].state == 'covered' then
            grid[selectedY][selectedX].state = 'flag'
        elseif grid[selectedY][selectedX].state == 'flag' then
            grid[selectedY][selectedX].state = 'question'
        elseif grid[selectedY][selectedX].state == 'question' then
            grid[selectedY][selectedX].state = 'covered'
        end
    end
end
`

### Prevent uncovering flags

If a cell has a flag, then it can't be uncovered by a left click.

`
function love.mousereleased(mouseX, mouseY, button)
    if button == 1 |and grid[selectedY][selectedX].state ~= 'flag'| then
        -- etc.
    end
end
`

### Question marks don't stop fill

Positions are added to the uncover stack if the cell's state is covered or a question mark (but not a flag).

`
function love.mousereleased(mouseX, mouseY, button)
                        -- etc.

                        if not (dx == 0 and dy == 0)
                        and grid[y + dy]
                        and grid[y + dy][x + dx]
                        and |(|
                            grid[y + dy][x + dx].state == 'covered'
                            |or grid[y + dy][x + dx].state == 'question'|
                        |)| then
                            table.insert(stack, {
                                    x = x + dx,
                                    y = y + dy
                                }
                            )
                        
                        -- etc.
end
`

### Change cell image when left mouse button is down over flag

If the left mouse button is down when the mouse is on a cell with a flag, then the cell is drawn with the covered image.

`
function love.draw()
                -- etc. 

                if x == selectedX and y == selectedY then
                    if love.mouse.isDown(1) then
                        |if grid[y][x].state == 'flag' then|
                        |    drawCell(images.covered, x, y)|
                        |else|
                            drawCell(images.uncovered, x, y)
                        |end|
                    else
                        drawCell(images.covered_highlighted, x, y)
                    end
                    
                -- etc.
end
`

### Game over

If a flower is uncovered, then the game is over.

A variable is made to store whether the game is over or not.

For now, clicking cells does nothing if the game is over.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.

    gameOver = false
end

function love.mousereleased(mouseX, mouseY, button)
    |if not gameOver then|
        if button == 1 and grid[selectedY][selectedX].state ~= 'flag' then
            |if grid[selectedY][selectedX].flower then|
            |    grid[selectedY][selectedX].state = 'uncovered'|
            |    gameOver = true|
            |else|
                local stack = {
                    {
                        x = selectedX,
                        y = selectedY,
                    }
                }

                -- etc.
            |end|
        end
    |end|
end
`

### Game won

If there are no cells which are covered and don't have a flower, then the game is won.

`
function love.mousereleased(mouseX, mouseY, button)
    if not gameOver then
        if button == 1 and grid[selectedY][selectedX].state ~= 'flag' then
            -- etc.

            if grid[selectedY][selectedX].flower then
                -- etc.
            else
                -- etc.

                |local complete = true|

                |for y = 1, gridYCount do|
                |    for x = 1, gridXCount do|
                |        if grid[y][x].state ~= 'uncovered' and not grid[y][x].flower then|
                |            complete = false|
                |        end|
                |    end|
                |end|

                |if complete then|
                |    gameOver = true|
                |end|
            end
        end
    end
end
`

### New game on next click

If the game is over and a mouse button is clicked, then the game is reset.

For now, `love.load` is called to reset the game.

`
function love.mousereleased(mouseX, mouseY, button)
    if not gameOver then
        -- etc.
    |else|
    |    love.load()|
    end
end
`

### Don't highlight when game is over

When the game is over, the mouse no longer highlights cells.

`
function love.draw()
    for y = 1, gridYCount do
        for x = 1, gridXCount do

            -- etc.

            if grid[y][x].state == 'uncovered' then
                drawCell(images.uncovered, x, y)
            else
                if x == selectedX and y == selectedY |and not gameOver| then

            -- etc.
end
`

### Hide flowers until game is over

The flowers aren't drawn until the game is over.

`
function love.draw()
            -- etc.

            if grid[y][x].flower |and gameOver| the
                drawCell(images.flower, x, y)

            -- etc.
end
`

!

### Hide numbers for covered cells

If a cell is not uncovered, then its surrounding flower count is not shown.

`
function love.draw()
            -- etc.

            if grid[y][x].flower and gameOver then
                drawCell(images.flower, x, y)
            elseif getSurroundingFlowerCount(x, y) > 0 |and grid[y][x].state == 'uncovered'| then
                drawCell(images[getSurroundingFlowerCount(x, y)], x, y)
            end

            -- etc.
end
`

!

### Preventing clicking on flower on the first click

So that the first click doesn't uncover a flower, the code for placing flowers is moved so that it runs when a mouse button is clicked, and the cell under the mouse cursor is not added to the possible flower positions.

A variable is created to store whether a click is the first click of the game.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.

    firstClick = true
end

function love.mousereleased(mouseX, mouseY, button)
    if not gameOver then
        if button == 1 and grid[selectedY][selectedX].state ~= 'flag' then
            |if firstClick then|
                |firstClick = false|

                local possibleFlowerPositions = {}
                for y = 1, gridYCount do
                    for x = 1, gridXCount do
                        |if not (x == selectedX and y == selectedY) then|
                            table.insert(possibleFlowerPositions, {x = x, y = y})
                        |end|
                    end
                end

                for flowerIndex = 1, 40 do
                    local position = table.remove(possibleFlowerPositions, love.math.random(#possibleFlowerPositions))
                    grid[position.y][position.x].flower = true
                end
            |end|

            if grid[selectedY][selectedX].flower then
                grid[selectedY][selectedX].state = 'uncovered'
                gameOver = true
            else

            -- etc.
end
`

### Resetting

When the game is over only some variables need to be reset, so a function is made.

`
function love.load()
    images = {}
    for imageIndex, image in ipairs({
        -- etc.
    }) do
        -- etc.
    end
    
    cellSize = 18
    
    gridXCount = 19
    gridYCount = 14

    function getSurroundingFlowerCount(x, y)
        -- etc.
    end

    |function reset()|
        grid = {}
        for y = 1, gridYCount do
            grid[y] = {}
            for x = 1, gridXCount do
                grid[y][x] = {
                    flower = false,
                    state = 'covered', -- 'covered', 'uncovered', 'flag', 'question'
                }
            end
        end

        gameOver = false
        firstClick = true
    |end|

    |reset()|
end

function love.mousereleased(mouseX, mouseY, button)
    if not gameOver then
        -- etc.
    else
        |reset()|
    end
end
`
