## Rules

The dealer and player are both dealt two cards. The dealer's first card is hidden from the player.

The player can hit (i.e. take another card) or stand (i.e. stop taking cards).

If the total value of the player's hand goes over 21 they have gone bust and can't take more cards.

Face cards (king, queen and jack) have a value of 10, and aces have a value of 11 unless this would make the total value of the hand go above 21, in which case they have a value of 1.

After the player has stood or gone bust, the dealer takes cards until the total of their hand is 17 or over.

The round is then over, and the hand with the highest total (if the total is 21 or under) wins the round.

### Controls
& *Left click* & Click on hit or stand button

## Overview

Each card is represented by a table containing a string representing its suit, and a number representing its rank. Jacks, queens and kings are represented by the numbers 11, 12 and 13.

The deck initially contains one of every card.

!

The player's and dealer's hands are tables, and cards are removed from the deck at random positions and inserted into their hands when they take cards.

The cards are assembled from the following images, with the images colored or flipped horizontally or vertically as necessary:

## Coding

### The deck of cards

Each card is represented by a table containing a string representing its suit, and a number representing its rank. Jacks, queens and kings are represented by the numbers 11, 12 and 13.

A table for the deck is created containing one of every card.

`
function love.load()
    deck = {}
    for suitIndex, suit in ipairs({'club', 'diamond', 'heart', 'spade'}) do
        for rank = 1, 13 do
            print('suit: '..suit..', rank: '..rank)
            table.insert(deck, {suit = suit, rank = rank})
        end
    end
    print('Total number of cards in deck: '..#deck)
end
`

### Taking cards for the player's hand

A table for the player's hand is created.

A card is removed from the deck table at a random index between 1 and the number of cards in the deck. This card is inserted into the player's hand.

This happens again for the player's second card.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.

    playerHand = {}
    table.insert(playerHand, table.remove(deck, love.math.random(#deck)))
    table.insert(playerHand, table.remove(deck, love.math.random(#deck)))
    
    -- Temporary
    print('Player hand:')
    for cardIndex, card in ipairs(playerHand) do
        print('suit: '..card.suit..', rank: '..card.rank)
    end
    print('Total number of cards in deck: '..#deck)
end
`

~
Player hand:
suit: heart, rank: 1
suit: spade, rank: 12
Total number of cards in deck: 50
~

### Displaying state

For now, information about the state of the game will be displayed as text.

A table is created for the output strings, and is concatenated then drawn to the screen.

`
function love.draw()
    local output = {}

    table.insert(output, 'Player hand:')
    for cardIndex, card in ipairs(playerHand) do
        table.insert(output, 'suit: '..card.suit..', rank: '..card.rank)
    end

    love.graphics.print(table.concat(output, '\n'), 15, 15)
end
`

!

### Dealing the dealer's hand

A table is created for the dealer's hand and two random cards from the deck are inserted into it.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.

    playerHand = {}
    table.insert(playerHand, table.remove(deck, love.math.random(#deck)))
    table.insert(playerHand, table.remove(deck, love.math.random(#deck)))

    |dealerHand = {}|
    |table.insert(dealerHand, table.remove(deck, love.math.random(#deck)))|
    |table.insert(dealerHand, table.remove(deck, love.math.random(#deck)))|
end

function love.draw()
    local output = {}

    table.insert(output, 'Player hand:')
    for cardIndex, card in ipairs(playerHand) do
        table.insert(output, 'suit: '..card.suit..', rank: '..card.rank)
    end

    |table.insert(output, '')|

    |table.insert(output, 'Dealer hand:')|
    |for cardIndex, card in ipairs(dealerHand) do|
    |    table.insert(output, 'suit: '..card.suit..', rank: '..card.rank)|
    |end|

    love.graphics.print(table.concat(output, '\n'), 15, 15)
end
`

!

### Simplifying code

The only difference between the code for inserting a card into the player's hand and inserting a card the dealer's hand is the hand to insert it into, so a function is made with the hand as a parameter.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.

    |local function takeCard(hand)|
        table.insert(|hand|, table.remove(deck, love.math.random(#deck)))
    |end|

    playerHand = {}
    |takeCard(playerHand)|
    |takeCard(playerHand)|

    dealerHand = {}
    |takeCard(dealerHand)|
    |takeCard(dealerHand)|
end
`

### Hitting

For now, the keyboard is used for input instead of on-screen buttons.

When the *h* key is pressed the player takes a card from the deck.

Since `takeCard` is used in `love.keypressed` it is made global.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.

    function takeCard(hand)

    -- etc.
end

function love.keypressed(key)
    if key == 'h' then
        takeCard(playerHand)
    end
end
`

!

### Getting total value of hand

For each hand, the rank of each card is added together to get the total value of the hand.

Currently this does not account for face cards having a value of 10 or the value of aces sometimes being 11.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    local function getTotal(hand)
        local total = 0
        for cardIndex, card in ipairs(hand) do
            total = total + card.rank
        end
        return total
    end

    table.insert(output, 'Total: '..getTotal(playerHand))

    -- etc.

    table.insert(output, 'Total: '..getTotal(dealerHand))

    -- etc.
end
`

!

### Total accounting for face cards

If a card's rank is higher than 10 (i.e. 11, 12 or 13) it is a face card and its value is 10.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    local function getTotal(hand)
        local total = 0
        for cardIndex, card in ipairs(hand) do
            |if card.rank > 10 then|
            |    total = total + 10|
            |else|
                total = total + card.rank
            |end|
        end
        return total
    end

    -- etc.
end
`

!

### Total accounting for ace

Aces have a value of 11 instead of 1 if it would increase the value of the hand without it going over 21.

First, the values of all of the cards in that hand are added together, counting aces as 1 instead of 11.

Then, if the hand has an ace and the total value of the hand is 11 or less, 10 is added to the total (10 is added instead of 11 because the total has already had 1 added to it for that ace). If the total of the value hand was 12 (or more) then an ace counting as 11 would make the value of the hand 22 (or more).

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    local function getTotal(hand)
        local total = 0
        |local hasAce = false|

        for cardIndex, card in ipairs(hand) do
            if card.rank > 10 then
                total = total + 10
            else
                total = total + card.rank
            end

            |if card.rank == 1 then|
            |    hasAce = true|
            |end|
        end

        |if hasAce and total <= 11 then|
        |    total = total + 10|
        |end|

        return total
    end

    -- etc.
end
`

!

### Standing

When the *s* key is pressed the player stands and, for now, the round is over.

The player can hit only when the round is not over.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.

    roundOver = false
end

function love.keypressed(key)
    if key == 'h' |and not roundOver| then
        takeCard(playerHand)
    |elseif key == 's' then|
    |    roundOver = true|
    end
end
`

### Displaying winner

When the round is over, the total of the player's hand is compared to the total of the dealer's hand and the winner is displayed.

Currently this does not account for busts (i.e. hands with a value of over 21).

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    if roundOver then
        table.insert(output, '')

        if getTotal(playerHand) > getTotal(dealerHand) then
            table.insert(output, 'Player wins')
        elseif getTotal(dealerHand) > getTotal(playerHand) then
            table.insert(output, 'Dealer wins')
        else
            table.insert(output, 'Draw')
        end
    end

    -- etc.
end
`

!

### Winner accounting for bust

The player or dealer wins if they haven't gone bust, and...
- their opponent has gone bust, or...
- their hand has a greater total than that of their opponent.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.

    roundOver = false
end

function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    if roundOver then
        table.insert(output, '')

        if |getTotal(playerHand) <= 21|
        |and (|
        |    getTotal(dealerHand) > 21|
        |    or| getTotal(playerHand) > getTotal(dealerHand)
        |)| then
            table.insert(output, 'Player wins')
        elseif |getTotal(dealerHand) <= 21|
        |and (|
        |    getTotal(playerHand) > 21|
        |    or| getTotal(dealerHand) > getTotal(playerHand)
        |)| then
            table.insert(output, 'Dealer wins')
        else
            table.insert(output, 'Draw')
        end
    end

    -- etc.
end
`

!

### Simplifying code

The only differences in the code determining if a hand has won is that hand and the hand of their opponent, so a function is made.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    if roundOver then
        table.insert(output, '')

        |local function hasHandWon(thisHand, otherHand)|
            return getTotal(|thisHand|) <= 21
            and (
                getTotal(|otherHand|) > 21
                or getTotal(|thisHand|) > getTotal(|otherHand|)
            )
        |end|

        if |hasHandWon(playerHand, dealerHand)| then
            table.insert(output, 'Player wins')
        elseif |hasHandWon(dealerHand, playerHand)| then
            table.insert(output, 'Dealer wins')
        else
            table.insert(output, 'Draw')
        end
    end

    -- etc.
end
`

### Play again

When a key is pressed and the round is over, for now `love.load` is called to start another game.

`
function love.keypressed(key)
    |if not roundOver then|
        if key == 'h' and not roundOver then
            takeCard(playerHand)
        elseif key == 's' then
            roundOver = true
        end
    |else|
    |    love.load()|
    |end|
end
`

### End round on bust or 21

If the player has gone bust or the value of their hand is already 21, the round is automatically over.

Since this requires getting the total value of a hand, `getTotal` is moved into `love.load`.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.

    function getTotal(hand)
        -- etc.
    end
end

function love.keypressed(key)
    if not roundOver then
        if key == 'h' and not roundOver then
            takeCard(playerHand)
            |if getTotal(playerHand) >= 21 then|
            |    roundOver = true|
            |end|
        elseif key == 's' then
            roundOver = true
        end
    else
        love.load()
    end
end
`

### Dealer hitting

If the player has stood, gone bust or has 21, the dealer takes cards while the value of their hand is less than 17.

`
function love.keypressed(key)
    if not roundOver then
        if key == 'h' and not roundOver then
            takeCard(playerHand)
            if getTotal(playerHand) >= 21 then
                roundOver = true
            end
        elseif key == 's' then
            roundOver = true
        end

        |if roundOver then|
        |    while getTotal(dealerHand) < 17 do|
        |        takeCard(dealerHand)|
        |    end|
        |end|
    else
        love.load()
    end
end
`

!

### Hiding dealer's first card

Until the round is over the dealer's first card (i.e. the first item of the dealer's hand table) is hidden.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    table.insert(output, 'Dealer hand:')
    for cardIndex, card in ipairs(dealerHand) do
        |if not roundOver and cardIndex == 1 then|
        |    table.insert(output, '(Card hidden)')|
        |else|
            table.insert(output, 'suit: '..card.suit..', rank: '..card.rank)
        |end|
    end

    -- etc.
end
`

!

### Hiding dealer's total

Until the round is over the total of the dealer's hand is hidden.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    |if roundOver then|
        table.insert(output, 'Total: '..getTotal(dealerHand))
    |else|
    |    table.insert(output, 'Total: ?')|
    |end|

    -- etc.
end
`

!

### Loading images

All of the images used for drawing cards are loaded.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.

	images = {}
	for nameIndex, name in ipairs({
		1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
		'pip_heart', 'pip_diamond', 'pip_club', 'pip_spade',
		'mini_heart', 'mini_diamond', 'mini_club', 'mini_spade',
		'card', 'card_face_down',
		'face_jack', 'face_queen', 'face_king',
	}) do
		images[name] = love.graphics.newImage('images/'..name..'.png')
	end
end
`

### Drawing cards

The text display is commented out.

The cards in the player's hand are looped through and, for now, a blank card is drawn for each one.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.

    love.graphics.setBackgroundColor(255, 255, 255)
end

function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    --love.graphics.print(table.concat(output, '\n'), 15, 15)

    for cardIndex, card in ipairs(playerHand) do
        love.graphics.draw(images.card, (cardIndex - 1) * 60)
    end
end
`

!

### Drawing text for suit and rank

For now, the suit and rank of each card is drawn as text.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    for cardIndex, card in ipairs(playerHand) do
        |love.graphics.setColor(255, 255, 255)|
        love.graphics.draw(images.card, (cardIndex - 1) * 60, 0)

        |love.graphics.setColor(0, 0, 0)|
        |love.graphics.print(card.suit, (cardIndex - 1) * 60, 0)|
        |love.graphics.print(card.rank, (cardIndex - 1) * 60, 15)|
    end
end
`

!

### Test hands

The code for drawing a card is made into a function, and test hands are created.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    |local function drawCard(card, x, y)|
        love.graphics.setColor(255, 255, 255)
        love.graphics.draw(images.card, |x|, |y|)

        love.graphics.setColor(0, 0, 0)
        love.graphics.print(card.suit, |x|, |y|)
        love.graphics.print(card.rank, |x|, |y +| 15)
    |end|
    
    |local testHand1 = {|
    |    {suit = 'club', rank = 1},|
    |    {suit = 'diamond', rank = 2},|
    |    {suit = 'heart', rank = 3},|
    |    {suit = 'spade', rank = 4},|
    |    {suit = 'club', rank = 5},|
    |    {suit = 'diamond', rank = 6},|
    |    {suit = 'heart', rank = 7},|
    |}|
    
    |for cardIndex, card in ipairs(testHand1) do|
    |    drawCard(card, (cardIndex - 1) * 60, 0)|
    |end|

    |local testHand2 = {|
    |    {suit = 'spade', rank = 8},|
    |    {suit = 'club', rank = 9},|
    |    {suit = 'diamond', rank = 10},|
    |    {suit = 'heart', rank = 11},|
    |    {suit = 'spade', rank = 12},|
    |    {suit = 'club', rank = 13},|
    |}|
    
    |for cardIndex, card in ipairs(testHand2) do|
    |    drawCard(card, (cardIndex - 1) * 60, 80)|
    |end|
end
`

!

### Drawing rank

The card's rank is drawn by indexing the image table with the card's rank, which corresponds to the appropriate image file.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    local function drawCard(card, x, y)
        love.graphics.setColor(255, 255, 255)
        love.graphics.draw(images.card, x, y)

        love.graphics.setColor(0, 0, 0)
        |love.graphics.draw(images[card.rank], x + 3, y + 4)|
    end
end
`
!

### Drawing bottom number

The card's rank is drawn at the bottom right corner minus the same offset added to the rank drawn at the top.

The image is flipped both horizontally and vertically.

To calculate the image's X and Y positions, the card's width and height are needed (and they will also be used when drawing the suit and pips), and the offset from the corner is reused from drawing the top number, so variables are made for these.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    local function drawCard(card, x, y)
        love.graphics.setColor(255, 255, 255)
        love.graphics.draw(images.card, x, y)

        love.graphics.setColor(0, 0, 0)

        |local cardWidth = 53|
        |local cardHeight = 73|
        |local numberOffsetX = 3|
        |local numberOffsetY = 4|

        love.graphics.draw(
            images[card.rank],
            x + |numberOffsetY|,
            y + |numberOffsetY|
        )
        |love.graphics.draw(|
        |    images[card.rank],|
        |    x + cardWidth - numberOffsetX,|
        |    y + cardHeight - numberOffsetY,|
        |    0,|
        |    -1|
        |)|
    end
    
    -- etc.
end
`

!

### Drawing suit

The suit is drawn similarly to the rank.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    local function drawCard(card, x, y)
        -- etc.

        local suitOffsetX = 3
        local suitOffsetY = 14
        local suitImage = images['mini_'..card.suit]

        love.graphics.draw(
            suitImage,
            x + suitOffsetX,
            y + suitOffsetY
        )
        love.graphics.draw(
            suitImage,
            x + cardWidth - suitOffsetX,
            y + cardHeight - suitOffsetY,
            0,
            -1
        )
    end
    
    -- etc.
end
`

### Simplifying code

The only differences between drawing the rank and suit are the image and the offset, so a function is made with these as parameters.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    local function drawCard(card, x, y)
        -- etc.

### Setting color based on suit

If the card's suit is diamonds or hearts, the color of the rank and suit is red, otherwise for clubs and spades it is black.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    local function drawCard(card, x, y)
        love.graphics.setColor(255, 255, 255)
        love.graphics.draw(images.card, x, y)

        -- Removed: love.graphics.setColor(0, 0, 0)

        |if card.suit == 'heart' or card.suit == 'diamond' then|
        |    love.graphics.setColor(228, 15, 100)|
        |else|
        |    love.graphics.setColor(50, 50, 50)|
        |end|

        -- etc.
    end
end
`

!

### Drawing face cards

If the card's rank is 11, 12 or 13, the image for the jack, queen or king is drawn.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    local function drawCard(card, x, y)
        -- etc.

        if card.rank > 10 then
            local faceImage
            if card.rank == 11 then
                faceImage = images.face_jack
            elseif card.rank == 12 then
                faceImage = images.face_queen
            elseif card.rank == 13 then
                faceImage = images.face_king
            end
            love.graphics.setColor(255, 255, 255)
            love.graphics.draw(faceImage, x + 12, y + 11)
        end
    end

    -- etc.
end
`

!

### Drawing ace

If the card is an ace a pip is drawn in the middle of the card.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    local function drawCard(card, x, y)
        -- etc.

        if card.rank > 10 then
            -- etc.
        |else|
        |    local pipImage = images['pip_'..card.suit]|
        |    if card.rank == 1 then|
        |        love.graphics.draw(pipImage, x + 21, y + 31)|
        |    end|
        end
    end

    |local testHand = {|
    |    {suit = 'club', rank = 1},|
    |    {suit = 'diamond', rank = 1},|
    |    {suit = 'heart', rank = 1},|
    |    {suit = 'spade', rank = 1},|
    |}|
    
    for cardIndex, card in ipairs(|testHand|) do
        drawCard(card, (cardIndex - 1) * 60, 0)
    end
end
`

!

### Drawing 2

For a rank of 2, two pips are drawn.

The first pip is in the middle on the X axis and at the top plus an offset of 7 on the Y axis.

The second pip is also in the middle on the X axis, and is "mirrored" on the Y axis by being offset by 7 from the bottom and drawn flipped both horizontally and vertically, similarly to the rank and suit.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    local function drawCard(card, x, y)
        -- etc.

        if card.rank > 10 then
            -- etc.
        else
            local pipImage = images['pip_'..card.suit]
            |local pipWidth = 11|
            if card.rank == 1 then
                love.graphics.draw(
                    pipImage,
                    x + 21,
                    y + 31
                )
            |elseif card.rank == 2 then|
            |    love.graphics.draw(|
            |        pipImage,|
            |        x + 21,|
            |        y + 7|
            |    )|
            |    love.graphics.draw(|
            |        pipImage,|
            |        x + 21 + pipWidth,|
            |        y + cardHeight - 7,|
            |        0,|
            |        -1|
            |    )|
            end
        end
    end

    local testHand = {
        {suit = 'club', rank = |2|},
        {suit = 'diamond', rank = |2|},
        {suit = 'heart', rank = |2|},
        {suit = 'spade', rank = |2|},
    }
    
    -- etc.
end
`

### Simplifying code

Numbers are reused, so these are made into variables.

`
function love.draw()
             -- etc.

            local pipImage = images['pip_'..card.suit]
            local pipWidth = 11

            |local xMid = 21|
            |local yTop = 7|

            if card.rank == 1 then
                love.graphics.draw(
                    pipImage,
                    x + |xMid|,
                    y + 31
                )
            elseif card.rank == 2 then
                love.graphics.draw(
                    pipImage,
                    x + |xMid|,
                    y + |yTop|
                )
                love.graphics.draw(
                    pipImage,
                    x + |xMid| + pipWidth,
                    y + cardHeight - |yTop|,
                    0,
                    -1
                )
            end
            
            -- etc.
end
`

### Drawing 3

Drawing a 3 is the same as drawing both an ace and a 2.

The middle of the card on the Y axis is reused, so this is made into a variable.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    local function drawCard(card, x, y)
        -- etc.

        if card.rank > 10 then

        else
            local pipImage = images['pip_'..card.suit]
            local pipWidth = 11

            local xMid = 21
            local yTop = 7
            |local yMid = 31|

            if card.rank == 1 then
                love.graphics.draw(
                    pipImage,
                    x + xMid,
                    y + |yMid|
                )
            elseif card.rank == 2 then
                love.graphics.draw(
                    pipImage,
                    x + xMid,

                    x + xMid + pipWidth,
                    y + cardHeight - yTop,
                    0,
                    -1
                )
            |elseif card.rank == 3 then|
            |    love.graphics.draw(|
            |        pipImage,|
            |        x + xMid,|

### Simplifying code

Pips have an individual offsets, and can be "mirrored" on the X and Y axis.

A function is made with the offsets and whether to mirror on the X or Y axis as parameters.

### Positioning hands

The player's and dealer's hands are drawn.

They use the same space between the cards and offset on the X axis, so variables are made for these.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    local cardSpacing = 60
    local marginX = 10

    for cardIndex, card in ipairs(dealerHand) do
        drawCard(card, ((cardIndex - 1) * cardSpacing) + marginX, 10)
    end

    for cardIndex, card in ipairs(playerHand) do
        drawCard(card, ((cardIndex - 1) * cardSpacing) + marginX, 140)
    end
end
`

!

### Hiding dealer's first card

Until the round is over, the dealer's first card is hidden. Instead of drawing the card, another image is drawn for a face down card.

The Y position of the face down card is reused from drawing the dealer's other cards, so it is made into a variable.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    local cardSpacing = 60
    local marginX = 10

    for cardIndex, card in ipairs(dealerHand) do
        |local dealerMarginY = 30|
        |if not roundOver and cardIndex == 1 then|
        |    love.graphics.draw(images.card_face_down, marginX, dealerMarginY)|
        |else|
            drawCard(card, ((cardIndex - 1) * cardSpacing) + marginX, |dealerMarginY|)
        |end|
    end

    for cardIndex, card in ipairs(playerHand) do
        drawCard(card, ((cardIndex - 1) * cardSpacing) + marginX, 140)
    end
end
`

!

### Displaying totals

The totals of each hand are drawn.

The dealer's total is drawn only when the round is over.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    love.graphics.setColor(0, 0, 0)

    if roundOver then
        love.graphics.print('Total: '..getTotal(dealerHand), marginX, 10)
    else
        love.graphics.print('Total: ?', marginX, 10)
    end

    love.graphics.print('Total: '..getTotal(playerHand), marginX, 120)
end
`

!

### Displaying winner

When the round is over the result of the game is drawn.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    if roundOver then
        local function hasHandWon(thisHand, otherHand)
            return getTotal(thisHand) <= 21
            and (
                getTotal(otherHand) > 21
                or getTotal(thisHand) > getTotal(otherHand)
            )
        end

        local function drawWinner(message)
            love.graphics.print(message, marginX, 268)
        end

        if hasHandWon(playerHand, dealerHand) then
            drawWinner('Player wins')
        elseif hasHandWon(dealerHand, playerHand) then
            drawWinner('Dealer wins')
        else
            drawWinner('Draw')
        end
    end
end
`

!

### Drawing hit and stand buttons

The hit and stand buttons are drawn as rectangles with text on top.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    love.graphics.setColor(255, 127, 57)
    love.graphics.rectangle('fill', 10, 230, 53, 25)
    love.graphics.setColor(255, 255, 255)
    love.graphics.print('Hit!', 16, 236)

    love.graphics.setColor(255, 127, 57)
    love.graphics.rectangle('fill', 70, 230, 53, 25)
    love.graphics.setColor(255, 255, 255)
    love.graphics.print('Stand', 78, 236)
end
`

!

### Drawing play again button

The "play again" button is drawn occupying the same position as the other buttons, since it will only be visible when the round is over.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    --[[
    love.graphics.setColor(255, 127, 57)
    love.graphics.rectangle('fill', 10, 230, 53, 25)
    love.graphics.setColor(255, 255, 255)
    love.graphics.print('Hit!', 16, 236)

    love.graphics.setColor(255, 127, 57)
    love.graphics.rectangle('fill', 70, 230, 53, 25)
    love.graphics.setColor(255, 255, 255)
    love.graphics.print('Stand', 78, 236)
    --]]

    love.graphics.setColor(255, 127, 57)
    love.graphics.rectangle('fill', 10, 230, 113, 25)
    love.graphics.setColor(255, 255, 255)
    love.graphics.print('Play again', 34, 236)
end
`

!

### Basing text position on button position

The X and Y position of the text is based on the X and Y position of the buttons plus some offset.

Each button's X position is used twice, so these are made into variables.

The same Y position is used by all buttons, so this is made into a variable.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    |local buttonY = 230|

    |local buttonHitX = 10|
    love.graphics.setColor(255, 127, 57)
    love.graphics.rectangle('fill', |buttonHitX|, |buttonY|, 53, 25)
    love.graphics.setColor(255, 255, 255)
    love.graphics.print('Hit!', |buttonHitX + 6|, |buttonY + 6|)

    |local buttonStandX = 70|
    love.graphics.setColor(255, 127, 57)
    love.graphics.rectangle('fill', |buttonStandX|, |buttonY|, 53, 25)
    love.graphics.setColor(255, 255, 255)
    love.graphics.print('Stand', |buttonStandX + 8|, |buttonY + 6|)

    --[[
    |local buttonPlayAgainX = 10|
    love.graphics.setColor(255, 127, 57)
    love.graphics.rectangle('fill', |buttonPlayAgainX|, |buttonY|, 113, 25)
    love.graphics.setColor(255, 255, 255)
    love.graphics.print('Play again', |buttonPlayAgainX + 24|, |buttonY + 6|)
    --]]
end
`

### Simplifying code

The only difference between the code for drawing each button is the button's text, X position, width, and text offset on the X axis. A function is made with these as parameters.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    |local function drawButton(text, buttonX, buttonWidth, textOffsetX)|
        local buttonY = 230
        love.graphics.setColor(255, 127, 57)
        love.graphics.rectangle('fill', |buttonX|, buttonY, |buttonWidth|, 25)
        love.graphics.setColor(255, 255, 255)
        love.graphics.print(|text|, |buttonX + textOffsetX|, buttonY + 6)
    |end|

    |drawButton('Hit!', 10, 53, 16)|
    |drawButton('Stand', 70, 53, 8)|
    |--drawButton('Play again', 10, 113, 24)|
end
`

### Highlighting button when cursor is over it

The color of the rectangle changes when the mouse cursor is over it.

The cursor is over the button when...
- the mouse's X position is to the right of the button's left edge
- the mouse's X position is to the left of the button's right edge (i.e less than the position of the button plus the width of the button)
- the mouse's Y position is below the button's top edge
- the mouse's Y position is above the button's bottom edge (i.e. less than the position of the button plus the height of the button)

The button height is reused from drawing the button, so a variable is made.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    local function drawButton(text, buttonX, buttonWidth, textOffsetX)
        local buttonY = 230
        |local buttonHeight = 25|

        |if love.mouse.getX() >= buttonX|
        |and love.mouse.getX() < buttonX + buttonWidth|
        |and love.mouse.getY() >= buttonY|
        |and love.mouse.getY() < buttonY + buttonHeight then|
        |    love.graphics.setColor(255, 202, 75)|
        |else|
            love.graphics.setColor(255, 127, 57)
        |end|
        love.graphics.rectangle('fill', buttonX, buttonY, buttonWidth, |buttonHeight|)
        love.graphics.setColor(255, 255, 255)
        love.graphics.print(text, buttonX + textOffsetX, buttonY + 6)
    end

    -- etc.
end
`

!

### Clicking buttons

If a mouse button is released and the mouse is over a button then the button has been clicked, and for now the name of the button is printed.

Checking if the mouse is over a button is reused from drawing the button, so it is made into a function and is moved into `love.load`.

The X and Y positions and width and height of buttons are also reused from drawing the buttons, so they are also moved into `love.load`.

`
function love.load()
    -- etc.

    |buttonY = 230|
    |buttonHeight = 25|

    |buttonHitX = 10|
    |buttonHitWidth = 53|

    |buttonStandX = 70|
    |buttonStandWidth = 53|

    |buttonPlayAgainX = 10|
    |buttonPlayAgainWidth = 113|

    |function isMouseInButton(buttonX, buttonWidth)|
        |return| love.mouse.getX() >= buttonX
        and love.mouse.getX() < buttonX + buttonWidth
        and love.mouse.getY() >= buttonY
        and love.mouse.getY() < buttonY + buttonHeight
    |end|
end

function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    local function drawButton(text, buttonX, buttonWidth, textOffsetX)
        |-- Removed: local buttonY = 230|

        -- etc.
    end

    drawButton('Hit!', |buttonHitX|, |buttonHitWidth|, 16)
    drawButton('Stand', |buttonStandX|, |buttonStandWidth|, 8)
    --drawButton('Play again', |buttonPlayAgainX|, |buttonPlayAgainWidth|, 24)
end

function love.mousereleased()
    if isMouseInButton(buttonHitX, buttonHitWidth) then
        print('Hit!')
    elseif isMouseInButton(buttonStandX, buttonStandWidth) then
        print('Stand')
    --elseif isMouseInButton(buttonPlayAgainX, playAgainWidth) then
    --    print('Play again')
    end
end
`

### Showing play again button after round is over

The hit and stand buttons are shown while the round is in progress, and the play again button is shown when the round is over.

`
function love.draw()
    -- etc.

    |if roundOver then|
        drawButton('Play again', buttonPlayAgainX, buttonPlayAgainWidth, 24)
    |else|
        drawButton('Hit!', buttonHitX, buttonHitWidth, 16)
        drawButton('Stand', buttonStandX, buttonStandWidth, 8)
    |end|
end
`

### Using buttons

The code from `love.keypressed` is moved to `love.mousepressed`, and instead of using the keys it uses the on-screen buttons.

`
function love.|mousereleased|()
    if not roundOver then
        if |isMouseInButton(buttonHitX, buttonHitWidth)| then
            takeCard(playerHand)
            if getTotal(playerHand) > 21 then
                roundOver = true
            end
        elseif |isMouseInButton(buttonStandX, buttonStandWidth)| then
            roundOver = true
        end

        if roundOver then
            while getTotal(dealerHand) < 17 do
                takeCard(dealerHand)
            end
        end
    elseif |isMouseInButton(buttonPlayAgainX, buttonPlayAgainWidth)| then
        love.load()
    end
end
`

### Resetting

Only some variables need to be reset when the play again button is clicked, so a function is made.

`
function love.load()
    love.graphics.setBackgroundColor(255, 255, 255)

	images = {}
	for nameIndex, name in ipairs({
        -- etc.
	}) do
        -- etc.
	end

    function takeCard(hand)
        -- etc.
    end

    function getTotal(hand)
        -- etc.
    end

    buttonY = 230
    buttonHeight = 25

    buttonHitX = 10
    buttonHitWidth = 53

    buttonStandX = 70
    buttonStandWidth = 53

    buttonPlayAgainX = 10
    buttonPlayAgainWidth = 113

    function isMouseInButton(buttonX, buttonWidth)
        -- etc.
    end

    |function reset()|
        deck = {}
        for suitIndex, suit in ipairs({'heart', 'spade', 'club', 'diamond'}) do
            for rank = 1, 13 do
                table.insert(deck, {suit = suit, rank = rank})
            end
        end
        
        playerHand = {}
        takeCard(playerHand)
        takeCard(playerHand)

        dealerHand = {}
        takeCard(dealerHand)
        takeCard(dealerHand)

        handOver = false
    end

    |reset()|
end

function love.mousereleased()
    -- etc.

    elseif isMouseInButton(buttonPlayAgainX, buttonPlayAgainWidth) then
        |reset()|
    end
end
